1. Questions to Ask the Product Team (Missing Requirements)

Inventory Threshold:
  Do we need to store a minimum stock threshold per product per warehouse?
  Should low-stock alerts be per company or per warehouse?

Pricing Model:
  Can products have different prices in different warehouses or for different companies?
  Is there any discount or promotional price that we need to store?

Bundle Products:
  Are bundles fixed compositions, or can components vary dynamically?
  Do bundles have their own inventory count or just derive from component stock?

Suppliers:
  Can a supplier supply multiple companies, or is it company-specific?
  Do we need to track supplier lead times (delivery days)?

Inventory Changes:
  Should we track which user made the inventory change?
  Do we need to store the cost of inventory change?

Data Retention:
  How long should inventory history be stored?
  Do we need soft delete or permanent delete?

Location Details:
  Do warehouses have address details (city, state, country, GPS)?
